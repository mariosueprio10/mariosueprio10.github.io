        <li> <em>What is something you learned from this article?</em> One thing that I learned the designs that I see in my everyday life have actual meaning and not just something for aestetics. I think it is pretty cool to look at things at a deeper level and see where the small details are leading us and what kind of information is it trying to convey and what emotion.  </li>
        <li> <em>What was your favorite part of this article?</em> My favorite part of the article is that it encouraged me to really think about the small details on apps on my phone. The article really focused on training me to think about the different choices that the designers made and how those choices made me feel and think. </li>
        <li> <em>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool:</em>  "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself." </li>
        <li> <em>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why:</em> I would rate this a 9</li>
